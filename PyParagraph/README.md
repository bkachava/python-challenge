# PyParagraph - Python Challenges 
 
A Python script to automate the analysis of differetn types of passages of writing was created. 
A simple set of metrics for assessing complexity was designed to automate the analysis of any passage 

The resulting [Python script](main.py) does the following:
 - Import a text file filled with a paragraph. See [samples](Resources).
 - Assess the passage for each of the following: 
   * Approximate word count
   * Approximate sentence count
   * Approximate letter count (per word)
   * Average sentence length (in words)
 
 The script prints the analysis to the terminal.
