# PyBank - Python Challenges

In this challenge, a Python script for analyzing the financial records of a company was created. 
The financial [dataset](Resources/budget_data.csv) is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses.

The resulting [Python script](main.py) calculates each of the following:
 - The total number of months included in the dataset
 - The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
 - The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 - The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

The script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the [results](Output/results.txt).
