# PyPoll - Python Challenges

To help a small, rural town modernize its vote-counting process, a Python script was created. 
A set of [poll data](Resources), with three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate; was used. 

The resulting [Python script](main.py) calculates each of the following:
 - The total number of votes cast
 - A complete list of candidates who received votes
 - The percentage of votes each candidate won
 - The total number of votes each candidate won
 - The winner of the election based on popular vote

The script prints the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the [results](Output/results.txt).
